# Restaurant-website-EindExamen

This website was my final exam project, where I created an exceptional restaurant application with an array of impressive features. Among them, I developed a robust CRUD functionality and a user-friendly CMS. Notably, the application allowed servers and clients to effortlessly filter and sort through the menu based on various criteria such as food categories, prices, pictures, and detailed descriptions of each product. This enhanced user experience ensured that everyone could easily explore and discover their desired dishes. Moreover, I integrated permissions, ensuring that chefs had exclusive access to update order statuses and inform servers when the food was ready. As an additional highlight, the website boasted a seamless PDF generator that generated detailed bills in PDF format.
